I am currently a postdoc fellow at Swiss Data Science Center, ETH. I also serve as a guest researcher at Coastal NLP group at University of Copenhagen. Previously, I obtained my PhD degree at CUHK text mining group, supervised by Prof.Lam Wai in 2023.  

Currently, my research interest focuses on multimodal information retrieval and text mining problems, including social media based fashion analysis, multimodal dialogue systems, etc. I'm also interested in other aspects of NLP and IR in the multimodal domain.
